so.. today ive seen a guy posting that.. and my greed made me learn more about Lissajous Curve and have some play ground, so i made a javascript app to create them it in real time (because im feeling more happy, and i felt challenged, and i have to undust my brain because im not programming too much in the last years...
Hope i can do this things more than i im in the closer future :)

Every time i feel challenged by anotherone examples i think its very easy... but.. after one afternon working on it... i realize its not... 

So... ok i have a 0 on originality, but almost i have some day that im motivated to solve challenges, but of course i need TIME to do that.
